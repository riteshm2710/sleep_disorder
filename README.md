üìö Project Title:
"Predicting Sleep Disorders Based on Lifestyle and Health Factors"

üéØ Project Goal:
Using people's lifestyle, demographic, and health data to predict whether someone has a sleep disorder (like insomnia, apnea, or none).

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step ML Project Plan
1. Problem Definition
Type of Problem: Classification

Target Variable: Sleep Disorder (Predict the type of disorder)

Input Variables: Age, BMI, stress level, physical activity level, sleep duration, etc.

2. Load and Understand Data
 Load dataset (pandas)

View top 5 rows (.head())

Check columns, data types, and missing values

3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Summary statistics (.describe())

Check class balance (how many people have each disorder)

Correlation between features

Visualizations (using seaborn and matplotlib):

Histograms for numeric features

Bar plots for categorical features

Box plots for outliers

Heatmap for correlation

4. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values

Convert categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Occupation) into numeric using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding

Remove or fix outliers if needed

Feature engineering (e.g., bin ages into groups if useful)

5. Feature Selection
Choose important features for prediction

Remove unnecessary columns (like ID numbers or duplicate info)

Optionally use feature importance techniques (e.g., Random Forest Feature Importance)

6. Train-Test Split
Split data into training and testing datasets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test)

7. Model Selection
Try multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

XGBoost (advanced) etc..

8. Model Evaluation
Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

Confusion matrix to visualize predictions

9. Model Tuning (Optional)
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find best parameters
